				<h6 class="center"> <b> <br> Activities </b> </h6>
				<h6><i>Leadership Advantage</i><br></h3>
				<p>
					A student-run four-day leadership seminar for incoming College of Engineering
					students taking place before the Fall semester begins. Fosters teamwork, professional development,
					and a welcoming environment. I was a participant in the program in 2020, and while the program
					was virtual due to COVID-19 campus restrictions, I learned many valuable tips for succeeding
					academically and professionally. I became a facilitator in 2021 as we returned to in-person
					instruction, leading a group of ten participants through the experience. Activities included
					an egg drop competition, lunches with corporate recruiters, and a trebuchet building competition.
					Since 2022, I have been on the Executive Board as the Secretary, managing communications with 
					facilitators and participants.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h6><i>Triangle Fraternity</i><br></h3>
				<p>
					A social fraternity of engineers, scientists, and architects. I pledged in the Spring of 2021
					and have held leadership positions in every subsequent semester. As a member of the Judicial Board,
					I was to be knowledgeable of the constitution and bylaws of the organization and uphold the standards
					of our fraternity. As the community service chair, I organized outings to local parks to remove
					invasive species to help each member reach the required service hours per semester. As a member
					educator, I prepared and presented planned lessons to the 18-member pledge class about our history,
					ethics, etiquette, and expectations.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h6><i>Society of Applied Engineering Sciences</i><br></h3>
				<p>
					A professional organization for the Applied Engineering Sciences major at Michigan State
					University. Network with other undergraduate students and corporate representatives from
					Fortune 500 companies for engineering and business roles. I joined shortly after I was admitted to the
					Applied Engineering Sciences program in the Fall of 2022, and I was one of the most active members
					that academic year. As of April 2023, I am on the Executive Board as the Director of External Relations;
					I organize service events to give back to the local community which supports us.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h6><i>Students Consulting for Nonprofit Organizations</i><br></h3>
				<p>
					An entirely student-run organization offering pro-bono consulting services to charitable
					nonprofit organizations all over the country. During the Spring of 2023, I worked with a team of
					nine other students to provide services to a local crisis hotline. The primary goals were to
					increase reach on social media, connect with local resources, and advertise for long-term staff.
					I used Canva to create and distribute physical materials for advertising such as flyers and
					business cards.
